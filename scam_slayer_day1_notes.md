# Scam Slayer - Day 1 Progress

## âœ… Tasks Completed

### 1. **Environment Setup**
- Created a virtual environment: `scam_slayer_env`
- Installed required dependencies:
  - `pandas`
  - `nltk`
  - `scikit-learn`
  - `scipy`
  - `numpy`
- Verified Python version (Python 3.13)

### 2. **Dataset Preparation**
- Loaded phishing dataset: `merged_phishing_dataset.csv`
- Explored dataset structure and content

### 3. **Text Preprocessing**
- Implemented text cleaning pipeline:
  - Removed URLs and special characters
  - Converted text to lowercase
  - Tokenized words
  - Removed stopwords
  - Lemmatized words
- Applied preprocessing to dataset and saved cleaned text

### 4. **TF-IDF Vectorization**
- Applied **TF-IDF transformation** to the cleaned text
- Used `TfidfVectorizer` with `max_features=2000`
- Saved the TF-IDF matrix as a sparse `.npz` file

### 5. **Validation & Testing**
- Verified dataset processing and TF-IDF transformation
- Ensured matrix shape consistency:
  - `TF-IDF Matrix Shape: (164972, 2000)`
  - `Labels Shape: (164972, 1)`
- Confirmed **non-zero elements** in TF-IDF matrix (`8,617,398` values)

## ðŸ“Œ **Next Steps (Day 2)**
- Begin model selection and training using processed TF-IDF data
- Implement a **classification model** (Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, or Transformer-based model)
- Perform initial evaluation of model performance

ðŸŽ¯ **End of Day 1 - All Tasks Successfully Completed!** ðŸŽ¯
